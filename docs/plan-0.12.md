High-level motivation
- Consolidate and refine the RAG-based conversational memory introduced in v0.11 by improving user experience, reliability, and operability.
- Remove remaining architectural friction: eliminate polling for message display, simplify ConsoleIO through a State Pattern, and make background work inspectable and recoverable.
- Strengthen privacy and governance: optional redaction on storage and a purge capability.

Scope (in)
- Event-driven message display (Observer) to replace polling and reduce DB chatter.
- ConsoleIO State Pattern refactor to clarify input/streaming/command handling.
- Operability: failed_jobs storage and commands; richer metrics; environment-aware worker defaults.
- Privacy: optional redaction pipeline and purge command.
- RAG refinements: filters (namespace/tags/time-range), recency weighting parameter, lightweight caching for common queries, and simple retrieval logging for observability.
- Migrations: finalize the minimal framework started in v0.11 and document workflow.

Scope (out)
- New retrieval modalities (web search/tools) and agent tool decorators beyond basic logging/metrics (target v0.13).
- Model/provider changes beyond what’s necessary for stability.

Key technical decisions and hints
- Observer pattern: Use a thread-safe event bus within the Application process. MessageStream (Observable) publishes events: user_input_received, assistant_token_streamed, exchange_completed, worker_status_updated. ConsoleView and any loggers subscribe. Avoid DB polling in the chat loop.
- ConsoleIO State Pattern: Introduce explicit states (Idle, ReadingUserInput, StreamingAssistant, CommandMode, Paused). Each state owns its transitions and rendering responsibilities. This reduces branching in ConsoleIO and prevents input/output interleaving bugs.
- Failed jobs: Add failed_jobs table with job_type, ref_id (e.g., exchange_id), payload, error, failed_at, retry_count. Workers write here after terminal failure. Provide admin commands to list, inspect, and retry.
- Metrics: Counters and timers collected in-memory with periodic snapshot to DB for inspection; expose via commands. Track processed/failed/retried, queue depth, batch latencies, API rate limit backoffs, and RAG retrieval latencies (p50/p90/p99).
- Privacy: Redaction hook in summarization/embedding paths. Start with regex-based scrub for common secrets (tokens, emails, keys) and allow custom patterns via config. Purge command must delete summaries/embeddings for a scope and rebuild as needed. Provide dry-run.
- Caching: Small in-memory LRU for RAG retrieval keyed by rounded query embeddings and config knobs; include TTL and invalidate on new writes to relevant conversations. Keep it opt-in and bounded to avoid stale/bloated context.
- RAG parameters: Support namespace/tag/time-range filters and a tunable recency weight alpha; preserve token budget and global caps from v0.11.
- RAG logging: Add rag_retrieval_logs table to capture query characteristics, candidate counts, scores, filtering applied, cache hits, and retrieval latency; enables validation of automatic RAG effectiveness without the complexity of v0.13's deep search logging.
- Migrations: Keep versioned files in migrations/. Ensure schema_version monotonic progression, idempotency, and rollback guidance for risky steps. Do not rely on IF NOT EXISTS for structural changes.

Implementation phases

Phase 1: Event-driven message display (Observer) (2–3 hrs) ✅ COMPLETED
Goal: Replace polling with an in-process event bus and subscribers.
Tasks
- ✅ Introduce EventBus (publish/subscribe) with thread-safe queues and bounded buffers.
- ✅ Emit events from key points: user input start/end, exchange committed.
- ✅ Replace chat loop polling with subscription to EventBus; Formatter subscribes to exchange_completed event.
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with polling fallback when event_bus is not available.
Validation
- ✅ Chat loop remains responsive, no duplicated messages.
- ✅ All 1864 tests passing with 98.74% line coverage / 90.85% branch coverage.
Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for EventBus publish/subscribe and ordering guarantees (25 tests).
- ✅ Integration tests updated for event flow from ChatLoopOrchestrator to Formatter.
Implementation Notes
- Created EventBus class with thread-safe publish/subscribe pattern
- Added EventBus to Application initialization
- ChatLoopOrchestrator emits user_input_received and exchange_completed events
- Formatter subscribes to events and uses event-driven wait_for_completion (with polling fallback)
- All existing tests updated to mock event_bus where needed

Phase 2: ConsoleIO State Pattern (2–3 hrs) ✅ COMPLETED
Goal: Simplify ConsoleIO logic by modeling explicit states.
Tasks
- ✅ Define states and transitions: Idle → ReadingUserInput → StreamingAssistant → Idle; Idle → Progress → Idle; any → Paused.
- ✅ Encapsulate per-state rendering and input handling. Ensure clean cancellation and Ctrl-C behavior.
- ✅ Remove conditional logic based on @mode and replace with State Pattern.
Validation
- ✅ Clean transitions when switching between states. No lost inputs; no interleaved output.
- ✅ All 1884 tests passing with 98.65% line coverage / 90.71% branch coverage.
Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for all states (IdleState, ReadingUserInputState, StreamingAssistantState, ProgressState, PausedState).
- ✅ Unit tests for state transitions and invalid transition detection.
- ✅ 20 new tests added for State Pattern behavior.
Implementation Notes
- Created State Pattern with base State class and 5 concrete states
- ConsoleIO delegates to current state via @state variable (replaces @mode)
- Each state owns valid transitions and raises StateTransitionError for invalid ones
- Internal do_* methods contain actual implementation logic
- States can be paused from any state and resumed to previous state
- All existing tests updated to work with State Pattern

Phase 3: Operability — failed jobs and admin commands (2 hrs) ✅ COMPLETED
Goal: Make background failures visible and recoverable.
Tasks
- ✅ Migration: create failed_jobs table (job_type, ref_id, payload JSON, error TEXT, retry_count, failed_at).
- ✅ Workers: on terminal failure, record into failed_jobs. Provide helper to enqueue retry.
- ✅ Commands: /admin failures [--type=], /admin show <id>, /admin retry <id>, /admin purge-failures [--older-than].
Validation
- ✅ Induce failures in tests and verify they appear and can be retried.
Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for persistence and command flows (19 new tests for FailedJobRepository, AdminCommand).
Implementation Notes
- Created FailedJobRepository with full CRUD operations and filtering
- Added failure recording to all three workers (ExchangeSummarizer, ConversationSummarizer, EmbeddingGenerator)
- Implemented AdminCommand with subcommands: failures, show, retry, purge-failures
- All 1919 tests passing with 98.47% line coverage / 90.87% branch coverage

Phase 4: Metrics and environment defaults (1.5–2 hrs) ✅ COMPLETED
Goal: Increase visibility and make CI friendly.
Tasks
- ✅ Add counters/timers for workers. Compute p50/p90/p99.
- ✅ Expose via /worker exchange-summarizer status command (displays processing latency percentiles).
- ✅ Default worker auto-start off in CI (ENV flag CI=true) and on in dev.
Validation
- ✅ Commands display metrics with p50/p90/p99 latencies when available.
- ✅ CI runs without background churn (workers don't auto-start when CI=true).
Testing
- ✅ 16 new tests for MetricsCollector (counters, timers, percentiles, thread safety).
- ✅ Worker command tests verify metrics display in status output.
- ✅ Application tests verify CI environment skips worker auto-start.
- ✅ All 1943 tests passing with 98.49% line coverage / 90.87% branch coverage.
Implementation Notes
- Created MetricsCollector class with thread-safe counters and duration tracking
- Workers accept optional metrics_collector parameter and record processing durations
- BackgroundWorkerManager creates and manages MetricsCollector instances for each worker
- ExchangeSummarizerCommand displays performance metrics in status output when available
- Application.start_background_workers checks ENV["CI"] and skips auto-start in CI environments
- RAG metrics deferred (not critical for Phase 4 validation criteria)

Phase 5: Privacy — redaction and purge (2–3 hrs) ✅ COMPLETED
Goal: Provide basic privacy controls for stored summaries/embeddings.
Tasks
- ✅ Add redaction filter step configurable via ConfigStore (regex patterns and toggles). Apply before persisting summaries/embeddings.
- ✅ Implement /admin purge scope: conversation <id> | all. Transactionally delete embeddings and summaries as requested.
- ✅ Document risks and limitations of regex-based redaction via comments and test examples.
Validation
- ✅ Redaction removes targeted tokens (API keys, emails, secrets, bearer tokens).
- ✅ Purge deletes summaries and embeddings with dry-run support.
Testing
- ✅ 12 unit tests for RedactionFilter (pattern matching, custom patterns, enabled/disabled).
- ✅ 7 unit tests for AdminCommand purge subcommands (conversation, all, dry-run).
- ✅ All 1962 tests passing with 98.14% line coverage / 90.94% branch coverage.
Implementation Notes
- Created RedactionFilter class with configurable regex patterns (default + custom via JSON)
- Integrated RedactionFilter into ExchangeSummarizer and ConversationSummarizer
- Added History.purge_conversation_data and History.purge_all_data methods
- Added /admin purge command with conversation <id> and all scopes
- Dry-run support implemented for preview without actual deletion
- Note: Custom patterns require double-escaping in JSON (e.g., \\\\b for \b word boundary)

Phase 6: RAG refinements and caching (2.5–3.5 hrs) 🚧 IN PROGRESS (75% complete - 6/8 tasks done)
Goal: Improve relevance, latency, and observability of automatic RAG.
Tasks
- ✅ Create migration for rag_retrieval_logs table
- ✅ Implement search_conversations and search_exchanges methods in EmbeddingStore with JOIN support
- ✅ Create RAGRetrievalLogger class for logging retrieval metrics
- ✅ Integrate RAGRetrievalLogger into RAGRetriever
- ✅ Add basic time-range filtering: after_date and before_date parameters through full RAG pipeline
- ✅ Implement recency weight parameter alpha
- ⏳ Add namespace/tag filters to retrieval processors and commands (PAUSED - requires schema changes)
- ⏳ Introduce opt-in LRU cache keyed by rounded query embedding + config (NOT STARTED)
Validation
- ✅ RAG retrieval logging captures query_hash, candidates, scores, duration
- ✅ Recency weight parameter blends similarity and recency scores correctly
- ⏳ p90 retrieval improves with cache on repeated queries; relevance remains good
- ✅ Time filters correctly limit candidate pool; logs enable validation of automatic RAG effectiveness
Testing
- ✅ Migration tests verify rag_retrieval_logs table creation and idempotency (3 tests)
- ✅ EmbeddingStore tests for search_conversations and search_exchanges (11 tests)
- ✅ RAGRetrievalLogger tests for logging, query hashing, and recent logs retrieval (10 tests)
- ✅ RAGRetriever tests verify logger integration and metrics logging (2 tests)
- ✅ Recency weight tests for both conversations and exchanges (10 new tests covering alpha=0.0, 1.0, 0.5, edge cases)
- ⏳ Unit tests for filters (namespace/tag), cache hit/miss behavior; integration test for invalidation on new summaries
Implementation Notes (Partial - 6/8 tasks complete)
- ✅ Created migration 007 for rag_retrieval_logs with indexes on timestamp, query_hash, and cache_hit
- ✅ Added search_conversations and search_exchanges to EmbeddingStore with JOIN support for fetching conversation/exchange metadata
- ✅ Implemented RAGRetrievalLogger with query hash generation (using rounded embeddings for cache grouping)
- ✅ Integrated RAGRetrievalLogger into RAGRetriever as optional parameter; logs query_hash, candidates, scores, duration, and cache_hit
- ✅ Implemented time-range filtering with after_date and before_date parameters in EmbeddingStore search methods
- ✅ Integrated time-range parameters through full RAG pipeline (RAGContext, RAGRetriever, search processors)
- ✅ Added 8 tests for time-range filtering in EmbeddingStore (both conversations and exchanges)
- ✅ Implemented recency weight parameter alpha in EmbeddingStore with blended scoring (similarity * alpha + recency * (1-alpha))
- ✅ Added recency_weight parameter to RAGContext, RAGRetriever, and search processors
- ✅ Added 10 tests for recency weighting covering pure similarity (alpha=1.0), pure recency (alpha=0.0), blended (alpha=0.5), and edge cases
- ⏳ Namespace/tag filtering requires conversations table schema changes (not yet in v0.11 baseline)
- ⏳ LRU cache feature pending
- All 2008 tests passing with 98.11% line coverage / 90.55% branch coverage

Phase 7: Migrations and developer workflow polish (1 hr)
Goal: Solidify migration ergonomics and documentation.
Tasks
- Add generator Rake task to create timestamped migration files with up/down skeletons.
- Document migration workflow in docs and guardrails (no destructive changes without backups).
Validation
- New migration generated and applied in a smoke run.

Success criteria
- UX: Smooth, non-polling message display; clean console behavior across states; responsive streaming.
- Operability: Operators can view and retry failed jobs; metrics visible with p90s for workers and RAG.
- Privacy: Redaction can be enabled; purge operates safely with confirmations and dry-run.
- Performance: With VSS, retrieval p90 remains < 500ms; with cache on repeated queries, p90 improves measurably. CPU usage reduced vs polling.
- Maintainability: Clear stateful ConsoleIO; migration workflow is simple and reliable.

Risks and mitigations
- Event floods: Use bounded queues and drop/merge policy for non-critical events (e.g., coalesce worker status updates).
- Redaction false positives/negatives: Start conservative; allow opt-out and custom filters.
- Cache staleness: Keep TTL short; invalidate on writes to relevant conversations.
- Command complexity: Keep admin commands minimal and focused; extend only as needed.

Notes
- Preserve the ethos: tests accompany each phase; no instance_variable_get hacks; parameterized SQL; explicit types.
- RAG retrieval logging provides lightweight observability of automatic RAG performance without the complexity of v0.13's deep search logging; helps validate that automatic retrieval is working effectively and informs tuning decisions.
- Defer tool decorators and broader telemetry integrations to v0.13 to keep v0.12 focused on UX and operability.
