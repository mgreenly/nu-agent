Nu-Agent Plan: User Documentation

Last Updated: 2025-10-31
Plan Status: Ready to execute

## Overview

Create comprehensive user-facing documentation for nu-agent CLI users, organized as topic-based files that progress from basic installation to advanced features. The plan is designed to be re-runnable: each phase lists specific behaviors and features to document, allowing periodic verification that docs remain accurate as the application evolves.

## Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                    (main entry point, overview)
├── getting-started.md          (installation, first run, basics)
├── configuration.md            (settings, options, customization)
├── features.md                 (core features and commands)
├── models.md                   (model selection and configuration)
├── rag-memory.md              (conversational memory and RAG)
├── advanced.md                (advanced usage, workers, admin)
└── troubleshooting.md         (common issues and solutions)
```

## High-Level Motivation

## Verification and Maintenance Process

### Initial Documentation Pass
1. Write content for each phase/file
2. Follow verification checklist for that file
3. Test all examples and commands
4. Commit completed file

### Periodic Review (quarterly or after major releases)
1. Start at Phase 1
2. Work through each file's verification checklist
3. Test commands and examples
4. Update content where behavior has changed
5. Add sections for new features
6. Remove sections for deprecated features
7. Commit updates with clear messages about what changed

### Quick Verification (for specific changes)
1. Identify which doc files are affected
2. Run verification checklist for those files only
3. Update and commit

### Tools to Assist Verification
- Command list generator: `grep 'def execute' lib/nu/agent/commands/*.rb`
- Model list: Run `/models` command
- Config options: `grep 'ArgumentParser' bin/nuagent`
- Feature check: Run test suite and look for new features

## Success Criteria

- **Completeness**: All user-facing features documented
- **Accuracy**: All examples and commands work as described
- **Accessibility**: New user can get started in < 10 minutes
- **Navigation**: Easy to find information on any topic
- **Maintainability**: Verification checklists make updates straightforward
- **Progressive**: Clear path from beginner to advanced usage

## Notes

- Keep language simple and jargon-free where possible
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include working examples for every feature
- Link between related topics liberally
- Maintain verification checklists as features change
- Consider user perspective: "How do I..." not "The system..."
- Each doc file should be independently useful
- Diagrams should be text-based (ASCII art or mermaid) for easy maintenance

## Future Enhancements

- Video tutorials (screencasts)
- Interactive examples
- FAQ section based on actual user questions
- Migration guides for version updates
- Integration examples (if API becomes available)
- Searchable documentation site
