# Plan for Parallel Tool Execution in Agentic Coding Assistant

## Overview
This document outlines a proposed approach to enhance the performance of the agentic coding assistant by implementing parallel execution of tool calls. The primary goal is to reduce the total execution time when multiple tools are invoked in a single response, thereby making the assistant faster for coding tasks.

## Current Implementation
Currently, tool calls are executed sequentially in the `handle_tool_calls` method within `tool_call_orchestrator.rb`. The method iterates over each tool call in a loop, waiting for one to complete before starting the next. This sequential processing is a bottleneck, especially when tool calls are independent and could run concurrently.

### Key Architectural Components
- **Tool Registry**: Tools are managed in `tool_registry.rb`, where each tool's execution is handled independently via the `execute` method (lines 30-35), but orchestration of multiple calls happens elsewhere.
- **Background Workers**: Managed by `background_worker_manager.rb`, long-running tasks like summarization and embeddings run in separate threads, independent of user-triggered tool calls. Workers use mutexes for synchronization (lines 33, 68, 91).
- **Console I/O**: `console_io.rb` handles user input/output with thread-safe mechanisms (mutex and queue, lines 51-56, 229-247), ensuring background threads can output results without interfering with user input.
- **Main Application**: `application.rb` coordinates the REPL loop (lines 209-229), uses `ConsoleIO` for I/O, and manages background workers (lines 149-159), with mutexes for critical sections (lines 190-206).

## Proposed Approach
To address this bottleneck, we propose modifying the `handle_tool_calls` method to execute independent tool calls in parallel using Ruby's threading capabilities. The high-level steps are:

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify independent tool calls that can run concurrently based on operation type (read/write), scope (confined/unconfined), and affected resources (e.g., file paths).
2. **Concurrent Execution**: Use Ruby's `Thread` class to execute independent tool calls in parallel within defined batches.
3. **Synchronization and Ordering**: Collect results from all tool calls and process them in the original order to maintain consistency in the message history.

### Dependency Management Rules
1. **Tool Classification**: Extend `tool_registry.rb` to include metadata for each tool: `operation_type` (:read or :write) and `scope` (:confined or :unconfined). For example, `file_read` is `:read, :confined`, while `execute_bash` is `:write, :unconfined`.
2. **Path Extraction**: For confined tools, extract affected paths from arguments (e.g., `file` parameter in `file_read`).
3. **Execution Rules**:
   - **Read Tools**: Can run in parallel with other reads unless blocked by a prior write on the same path.
   - **Write Tools with Specific Paths**: Must wait for prior operations on the same path and block subsequent operations on that path until complete.
   - **Write Tools with Unconfined Scope (e.g., `execute_bash`)**: Must wait for all prior tool calls to complete (acting as a barrier) and block all subsequent tool calls until finished, running in isolation.

### Architectural Patterns
1. **Metadata Pattern**: Add `operation_type` and `scope` to tool definitions in `tool_registry.rb` for classification without altering tool logic.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Pass tool registry metadata to `ToolCallOrchestrator` for decision-making, promoting loose coupling.
3. **Pipeline Processing**: Structure `handle_tool_calls` as a pipeline: analyze dependencies, batch calls, execute batches (parallel within batches), and aggregate results.
4. **Barrier Synchronization**: Treat unconfined write tools as barriers in the execution pipeline for safety.

### Integration with Current Architecture
- **Threading Model**: Use `Thread` for each tool call within a batch in `tool_call_orchestrator.rb`, similar to how `BackgroundWorkerManager` starts worker threads (lines 46-47). No thread pool needed initially as tool calls are typically short-lived.
- **Output Handling**: Use `ConsoleIO#puts` from tool threads to queue output results. The existing `Queue` and `Mutex` in `ConsoleIO` (lines 51-56) ensure thread-safe display without interleaving.
- **REPL Responsiveness**: Ensure the REPL loop in `application.rb` (lines 209-229) remains responsive by leveraging `ConsoleIO`’s asynchronous output handling via `IO.select` (lines 158-172).
- **Separation from Workers**: Background workers (`background_worker_manager.rb`) are distinct from tool calls. Parallel tool execution is independent, with potential conflicts mitigated by dependency rules.

## Conceptual Code Change
Below is a conceptual modification to the `handle_tool_calls` method in `tool_call_orchestrator.rb` (around lines 82-94):

```ruby
require 'thread'

# Define tools with unconfined scope (could be in tool_registry.rb as metadata)
UNCONFINED_WRITE_TOOLS = ['execute_bash', 'execute_python'].freeze

# Analyze tool calls for dependencies
tool_call_batches = []
current_batch = []
path_writes = {}  # Track last write operation per path

response["tool_calls"].each do |tool_call|
  tool_name = tool_call.dig("function", "name")
  tool_info = $tool_registry.get_tool(tool_name)
  operation_type = tool_info[:operation_type] || infer_operation_type(tool_name)  # e.g., :read or :write
  affected_path = extract_path_from_arguments(tool_call.dig("function", "arguments"))  # e.g., file parameter
  is_unconfined = UNCONFINED_WRITE_TOOLS.include?(tool_name) && operation_type == :write

  if is_unconfined
    # Unconfined write tools act as a barrier: wait for all prior operations and block subsequent ones
    tool_call_batches << current_batch unless current_batch.empty?
    tool_call_batches << [tool_call]  # Solo batch for this tool
    current_batch = []
    path_writes.each_key { |path| path_writes[path] = tool_call }  # Mark as blocking all paths
  elsif operation_type == :write && affected_path
    # Wait for any prior operations on this path
    if path_writes[affected_path] || current_batch.any? { |tc| extract_path_from_arguments(tc.dig("function", "arguments")) == affected_path }
      tool_call_batches << current_batch unless current_batch.empty?
      current_batch = [tool_call]
    else
      current_batch << tool_call
    end
    path_writes[affected_path] = tool_call
  elsif operation_type == :read && affected_path && path_writes[affected_path]
    # If there's a prior write on this path, start a new batch
    tool_call_batches << current_batch unless current_batch.empty?
    current_batch = [tool_call]
  else
    # Safe to add to current batch (independent read or no conflict)
    current_batch << tool_call
  end
end
tool_call_batches << current_batch unless current_batch.empty?

# Execute batches sequentially, but parallelize within each batch
tool_call_results = []
tool_call_batches.each do |batch|
  threads = []
  batch_results = []
  batch.each do |tool_call|
    threads << Thread.new do
      result = execute_tool_call(tool_call, messages.dup)
      batch_results << { tool_call: tool_call, result: result }
    end
  end
  threads.each(&:join)
  tool_call_results.concat(batch_results)
end

# Process results in original order
tool_call_results.sort_by { |r| response["tool_calls"].index(r[:tool_call]) }.each do |result_data|
  tool_call = result_data[:tool_call]
  result = result_data[:result]
  tool_result_data = build_tool_result_data(tool_call, result)
  save_tool_result_message(tool_call, tool_result_data)
  display_tool_result_message(tool_result_data)
  add_tool_result_to_messages(messages, tool_call, result)
end
```

## Explanation of Changes
- **Dependency Batching**: Tool calls are grouped into batches based on operation type, scope, and path to prevent conflicts.
- **Thread Creation**: Each tool call in a batch is executed in a separate thread, allowing parallel processing within batches.
- **Result Collection**: Results are stored with their corresponding tool call for later processing.
- **Synchronization**: `threads.each(&:join)` ensures all threads in a batch complete before moving to the next batch.
- **Ordered Processing**: Results are sorted by the original order of tool calls to ensure the message history reflects the intended sequence.

## Challenges and Considerations
1. **Race Conditions**: If multiple tools access the same resource (e.g., a file), parallel execution could lead to conflicts. The dependency batching mitigates this, but edge cases (e.g., dynamic paths) need testing.
2. **Thread Safety**: Ensure that `execute_tool_call` and shared state (like `@history`) are thread-safe, using mutexes if needed, following the pattern in `Application` (lines 190-206).
3. **Performance Overhead**: For very quick tool calls, thread creation overhead might outweigh benefits. A thread pool or conditional parallelism could be explored.
4. **Output Volume**: If many parallel tools produce output, `ConsoleIO` queue backlog is unlikely to block REPL due to `IO.select`, but monitor during testing.
5. **Resource Conflicts with Workers**: Rare conflicts between tool threads and background workers can be mitigated by mutexes for shared resources.
6. **Interrupt Handling**: Ensure `ConsoleIO`’s interrupt handling (Ctrl-C, lines 261-262) works during parallel tool execution, with threads checking for interrupts or being killable.

## Implementation Plan

- [!] **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: Format inconsistency between components

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Critical Issue Found
**Issue**: DependencyAnalyzer expects nested format but API clients return flat format

**Estimated Commits**: 2

---

### Phase 8: Fix Format Inconsistency (URGENT)

**Objective**: Resolve the format mismatch between DependencyAnalyzer and API clients.

**Issue Summary**:
- API clients (Anthropic, OpenAI) return tool calls in **flat format**: `{ "name": "tool", "arguments": {...} }`
- DependencyAnalyzer expects **nested format**: `{ "function": { "name": "tool", "arguments": {...} } }`
- ParallelExecutor expects **flat format**: `tool_call["name"]`
- This causes dependency analysis to fail silently and use default metadata for all tools
- End-to-end tests use flat format (correct for production)
- DependencyAnalyzer unit tests use nested format (incorrect for production)

**TDD Steps**:
1. **RED**: Update DependencyAnalyzer specs to use flat format
   - Fix all specs in `dependency_analyzer_spec.rb` to use `{ "name": ..., "arguments": ... }`
   - Run specs - they should fail
   - Commit: "Update DependencyAnalyzer specs to use flat format (tests fail)"

2. **GREEN**: Update DependencyAnalyzer implementation
   - Modify `extract_tool_info` to support flat format: `tool_call["name"]`
   - Modify `path_in_current_batch?` to support flat format
   - Add backward compatibility for nested format if needed
   - Run specs until all pass
   - Commit: "Fix DependencyAnalyzer to support flat format from API clients"

3. **VERIFY**: Run full test suite
   - Ensure all dependency analyzer tests pass
   - Ensure all end-to-end tests still pass
   - Ensure parallel executor tests still pass
   - Commit: "Verify all tests pass with format fix"

4. **BENCHMARK**: Re-run performance benchmarks
   - Run `bundle exec rspec spec/benchmarks/parallel_execution_benchmark.rb`
   - Collect actual performance data with correct dependency analysis
   - Update `docs/parallel-execution-performance.md` with real results
   - Commit: "Document actual performance results after format fix"

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] DependencyAnalyzer handles flat format correctly
- [x] All dependency analyzer specs use flat format
- [x] All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- [x] Performance benchmarks show correct dependency batching
- [ ] Documentation updated with actual performance data (optional)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Commit**: 2a28214 - Fixed DependencyAnalyzer to support flat format from API clients

**Results**:
- All 2236 tests pass with 0 failures
- Coverage: 98.19% line, 90.15% branch
- Dependency analysis now correctly identifies batch boundaries
- End-to-end tests confirm parallel execution works correctly

**Estimated Commits**: 4 (actual: 1 - combined all fixes into single atomic commit)

### Phase 9.5: Add Debug Output for Parallel Execution Observability

**Objective**: Add batch/thread visibility to tool call output to make parallel execution observable during manual testing.

**Rationale**:
Without visibility into batching and threading, it's impossible to verify that parallel execution is working correctly. The current implementation provides no feedback about:
- How many batches were created from tool calls
- Which tools are in each batch
- Whether tools are running in parallel (multiple threads)
- Individual tool execution timing

**Design**: Enhance existing tool call output with batch/thread information instead of adding separate debug messages.

**Output Format Examples**:

**Single batch with 22 parallel tools (all independent reads):**
```
[DEBUG] Analyzing 22 tool calls for dependencies...
[DEBUG] Created 1 batch from 22 tool calls
[DEBUG] Batch 1: 22 tools (file_read x22) - parallel execution
[DEBUG] Executing batch 1: 22 tools in parallel threads

[Tool Call Request] (Batch 1/Thread 1) file_read (1/22)
  file: docs/README.md

(No batch/thread indicator shown when only one tool or all sequential)

**Key Observable Indicators**:
- ✅ Batch/thread numbers show which tools run together
- ✅ Multiple `[Tool Call Request]` messages appearing rapidly = parallel start
- ✅ `[Tool Use Response]` messages appearing out-of-order = parallel completion
- ✅ Thread numbers in responses match their requests
- ✅ Batch timing shows performance benefit

**Verbosity Levels**:
- **Verbosity 0**: No batch debug output, but batch/thread indicators still shown on tool messages
- **Verbosity 1**: Batch summary only ("Created 3 batches from 5 tool calls")
- **Verbosity 2**: Batch details + timing ("Batch 1 complete: 22/22 tools in 0.35s")
- **Verbosity 3**: Full details including dependency reasoning

**Implementation Changes**:

1. **ToolCallFormatter** (`lib/nu/agent/formatters/tool_call_formatter.rb`):
   - Modify `#display` to accept optional `batch:` and `thread:` parameters
   - Update `#display_header` to include "(Batch N/Thread M)" when present
   - Format: `[Tool Call Request] (Batch 1/Thread 3) file_read (5/22)`

2. **ToolResultFormatter** (`lib/nu/agent/formatters/tool_result_formatter.rb`):
   - Modify `#display` to accept tool call context with batch/thread info
   - Update `#display_header` to include "(Batch N/Thread M)" when present
   - Format: `[Tool Use Response] (Batch 1/Thread 3) file_read`

3. **ParallelExecutor** (`lib/nu/agent/parallel_executor.rb`):
   - Track current batch number (passed from orchestrator)
   - Assign thread number (1, 2, 3...) to each thread in batch
   - Include batch/thread in result_data: `{ batch: 1, thread: 3, tool_call: ..., result: ... }`
   - Add batch execution output: "Executing batch N: M tools in parallel threads"
   - Add batch completion output with timing: "Batch N complete: M/M tools in 0.35s"

4. **DependencyAnalyzer** (`lib/nu/agent/dependency_analyzer.rb`):
   - Add batch planning output (requires application reference)
   - Output: "Analyzing N tool calls for dependencies..."
   - Output: "Created M batches from N tool calls"
   - Output per batch: "Batch 1: 3 tools (file_read x3) - parallel execution"
   - Output barriers: "Batch 2: 1 tool (execute_bash) - BARRIER (runs alone)"

5. **ToolCallOrchestrator** (`lib/nu/agent/tool_call_orchestrator.rb`):
   - Pass batch number to ParallelExecutor when executing each batch
   - Pass batch/thread info to formatters when displaying tool calls/results
   - Extract batch/thread from result_data and pass to display methods

**TDD Steps**:

1. **RED**: Write failing specs for batch/thread visibility
   - Test ToolCallFormatter includes "(Batch N/Thread M)" when provided
   - Test ToolCallFormatter excludes batch/thread when not provided
   - Test ToolResultFormatter includes "(Batch N/Thread M)" when provided
   - Test ParallelExecutor includes batch/thread in result_data
   - Test DependencyAnalyzer outputs batch planning (with mock application)
   - Test ParallelExecutor outputs batch execution timing
   - Commit: "Add failing specs for batch/thread visibility"

2. **GREEN**: Implement batch/thread visibility
   - Modify ToolCallFormatter to accept and display batch/thread
   - Modify ToolResultFormatter to accept and display batch/thread
   - Modify ParallelExecutor to track and pass batch/thread numbers
   - Add batch planning output to DependencyAnalyzer
   - Add batch execution timing to ParallelExecutor
   - Update ToolCallOrchestrator to pass batch numbers and extract batch/thread info
   - Run tests until green
   - Commit: "Add batch/thread visibility to parallel execution"

3. **REFACTOR**: Polish output formatting
   - Format batch/thread consistently: "(Batch 1/Thread 3)"
   - Ensure thread-safe output doesn't corrupt
   - Add verbosity level controls for batch debug output
   - Format timing appropriately (ms for <1s, s for ≥1s)
   - Run full test suite + coverage
   - Commit: "Polish batch/thread visibility formatting"

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Tool call messages include "(Batch N/Thread M)" when executing in parallel
- [ ] No batch/thread shown when tool executes alone or sequentially
- [ ] Batch/thread numbers match between request and response
- [ ] Batch planning output shows dependency analysis (verbosity ≥1)
- [ ] Batch execution timing shows performance (verbosity ≥2)

### Phase 9: Manual Testing with Real API

**Objective**: Verify parallel tool execution works correctly in production with real API calls from Anthropic/OpenAI.

**Prerequisites**:
- All automated tests passing (2236 examples, 0 failures)
- API keys configured in secrets file
- Application starts without errors

**Manual Test Scenarios**:

#### Test 1: Parallel Independent Reads
**Goal**: Verify multiple file reads execute in parallel

**Steps**:
1. Start the application: `bundle exec ruby bin/nu-agent`
2. Enter this prompt:
   ```
   Read these 3 files and summarize what each does:
   - lib/nu/agent/tool_registry.rb
   - lib/nu/agent/path_extractor.rb
   - lib/nu/agent/dependency_analyzer.rb
   ```
3. Wait for LLM response with tool calls
4. Observe tool execution output

**Expected Behavior**:
- LLM returns 3 `file_read` tool calls
- All 3 execute in parallel (single batch)
- Results appear quickly (not sequential delay)
- All 3 file contents returned correctly
- LLM provides summary of all 3 files

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Tool calls use flat format: `{ "name": "file_read", "arguments": {...} }`
- ✅ DependencyAnalyzer creates 1 batch with 3 tools
- ✅ ParallelExecutor executes all in threads
- ✅ No errors during execution
- ✅ Results returned in correct order

#### Test 2: Read-Write Dependencies
**Goal**: Verify dependency batching for read-then-write on same file

**Steps**:
1. In the running session, enter:
   ```
   Read lib/nu/agent/version.rb, then write a new comment at the top
   ```
2. Observe batch creation
3. Verify file is read before write

**Expected Behavior**:
- LLM returns 2 tool calls: `file_read` then `file_write`
- DependencyAnalyzer creates 2 batches (read in batch 1, write in batch 2)
- Read executes first, completely finishes
- Write executes second with updated content
- File is modified correctly

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Batches separated correctly (not parallel)
- ✅ Read completes before write starts
- ✅ Write uses content from read result
- ✅ No race conditions or data corruption

#### Test 3: Barrier Synchronization (execute_bash)
**Goal**: Verify bash commands execute in isolation as barriers

**Steps**:
1. In the running session, enter:
   ```
   Read lib/nu/agent/version.rb, then run 'ls -la lib/nu/agent/',
   then read lib/nu/agent/parallel_executor.rb
   ```
2. Observe batching around bash command

**Expected Behavior**:
- LLM returns 3 tool calls: `file_read`, `execute_bash`, `file_read`
- DependencyAnalyzer creates 3 batches:
  - Batch 1: First file_read
  - Batch 2: execute_bash (solo)
  - Batch 3: Second file_read
- Bash executes alone, isolated from other operations

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ execute_bash in its own batch
- ✅ No tools run concurrently with bash
- ✅ Bash completes before subsequent operations
- ✅ All operations complete successfully

#### Test 4: Mixed Independent Operations
**Goal**: Verify optimal batching with mix of operations

**Steps**:
1. In the running session, enter:
   ```
   Read these 5 files:
   - lib/nu/agent/tool_registry.rb
   - lib/nu/agent/path_extractor.rb
   - lib/nu/agent/dependency_analyzer.rb
   - lib/nu/agent/parallel_executor.rb
   - lib/nu/agent/tool_call_orchestrator.rb
   ```
2. Observe all 5 execute in parallel

**Expected Behavior**:
- LLM returns 5 `file_read` tool calls
- DependencyAnalyzer creates 1 batch with all 5 tools
- All 5 execute concurrently in threads
- Noticeable performance improvement vs sequential

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Single batch with 5 tools
- ✅ Concurrent execution visible in timing
- ✅ All results correct and in order
- ✅ No thread safety issues

#### Test 5: Write-Write on Same Path
**Goal**: Verify sequential execution for multiple writes to same file

**Steps**:
1. In the running session, enter:
   ```
   Write "Line 1" to /tmp/test.txt, then append "Line 2" to /tmp/test.txt
   ```
2. Observe sequential batching

**Expected Behavior**:
- LLM returns 2 `file_write` tool calls on same path
- DependencyAnalyzer creates 2 batches
- First write completes before second starts
- File ends up with both lines

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Batches separated (no parallel writes to same file)
- ✅ No data corruption or race conditions
- ✅ Final file content is correct

#### Test 6: Error Handling in Parallel Execution
**Goal**: Verify error in one tool doesn't block others

**Steps**:
1. In the running session, enter:
   ```
   Read these files:
   - lib/nu/agent/tool_registry.rb
   - /nonexistent/file.txt (this will fail)
   - lib/nu/agent/path_extractor.rb
   ```
2. Observe that valid files are still read

**Expected Behavior**:
- LLM returns 3 `file_read` tool calls
- All 3 execute in parallel
- Middle one fails with error
- Other 2 succeed and return content
- LLM receives all 3 results (2 success, 1 error)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Successful tools complete despite error in batch
- ✅ Error is captured and returned
- ✅ No exception crashes the batch
- ✅ LLM can respond to partial results

#### Test 7: Real API Format Verification
**Goal**: Verify actual API responses use flat format

**Steps**:
1. Enable debug mode: `/debug on`
2. Set verbosity high: `/verbosity 3`
3. Make a request that triggers tool calls
4. Observe the raw API response in debug output

**Expected Behavior**:
- API response contains tool_calls array
- Each tool call uses flat format: `{ "id": "...", "name": "...", "arguments": "..." }`
- No nested `"function"` wrapper
- DependencyAnalyzer handles it correctly

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Confirm flat format from real API
- ✅ No parsing errors
- ✅ Dependency analysis works with real data
- ✅ Parallel execution proceeds correctly

**Debugging Tips**:
- Use `/debug on` to see detailed execution flow
- Use `/verbosity 3` for maximum output
- Check `coverage/` directory after tests for any missed code paths
- Monitor thread creation in debug output
- Look for "batch" mentions in output to verify batching

**Expected Issues & Solutions**:
1. **Thread overhead > benefits for fast operations**
   - This is expected and documented
   - Parallel execution still correct, just not faster for tiny files

2. **API doesn't return multiple tool calls**
   - This depends on the LLM's response
   - Try more explicit prompts requesting multiple operations

3. **Tools execute too fast to observe parallelism**
   - Use larger files or slower operations
   - Check timing metrics in debug output

**Documentation After Testing**:
1. Record any issues found
2. Document actual performance characteristics observed
3. Note any edge cases discovered
4. Update `docs/parallel-execution-performance.md` with real-world results

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 7 test scenarios pass
- [ ] No errors or crashes during manual testing
- [ ] Parallel execution observable and correct
- [ ] Dependency batching works as designed
- [ ] Real API format (flat) handled correctly
- [ ] Performance improvement visible for appropriate scenarios
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Thread safety confirmed (no corruption or races)

## Additional Enhancements
Beyond parallel execution, other optimizations could be explored:
1. **Batch Processing**: Modify tools to accept batch inputs where applicable (e.g., `file_read` could read multiple files in one call). This would require updates to tool definitions and the registry.
2. **Tool-Specific Caching**: Add caching logic at the registry level or within individual tools to store results of frequent operations.

## Feedback and Refinement
This plan is a comprehensive blueprint for parallel tool execution. Feedback is welcome on:
- Dependency analysis and batching logic for edge cases (e.g., dynamic paths, non-file resources).
- Thread safety mechanisms for shared state and integration with background workers.
- Prioritization of this optimization versus other enhancements like batch processing or caching.
