# Nu::Agent

This is a toy experiment in writing an AI Agent.  Mostly just to understand agents better but also specifically becase I want to experiment with how agents decide to use tools.

## Examples

The current behavior is almost entirely governed by the [meta-prompt](lib/nu/agent.rb#L22-L54).

### Example #1

```
$ exe/nu-agent --llm gemini
Nu Agent REPL
Using: Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash)
Type your prompts below. Press Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, or /exit to quit.
Type /help for available commands
============================================================

> search the web to find the most popular spotify song this week.

The most popular Spotify song globally this week (for the week ending October 17, 2025) is "Starlight Serenade" by Luna Nova.

### Example #2

````
$ exe/nu-agent --llm=gemini

Nu Agent REPL
Using: Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash)
Type your prompts below. Press Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, or /exit to quit.
Type /help for available commands
============================================================

> how many files are in the current working directory?

There are 10 files in the current working directory.

Tokens: 545 in / 82 out / 627 total

> which is the largest file?

The largest file in the current working directory is `Gemfile.lock`.

## Debug

Here's a debug example to see what's going on under the hood.

## Debug #1

Type your prompts below. Press Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, or /exit to quit.

## TODO

Future experiments I could do.

  * Have the system specific metadata info by dynamically generated.
  * Don't save the `meta-prompt` in the history.  Instead always wrap the most immediate request with it to maintain it's immediacy.
  * add a `/llm NAME` command so you can switch LLMs before any prompt.
  * add a `/model NAME` command so you can switch MODEL befor eany prompt.
  * lots of error/debug imrprovements
