# Nu::Agent

This is a toy experiment in writing an AI Agent.  Mostly just to understand agents better but also specifically becase I want to experiment with how agents decide to use tools.

## Examples

The current behavior is almost entirely governed by the [meta-prompt](lib/nu/agent.rb#L22-L36).

### Example #1

```
$ exe/nu-agent --llm gemini
Nu Agent REPL
Using: Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash)
Type your prompts below. Press Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, or /exit to quit.
Type /help for available commands
============================================================

> search the web to find the most popular spotify song this week.

The most popular Spotify song globally this week (for the week ending October 17, 2025) is "Starlight Serenade" by Luna Nova.

### Example #2

$ exe/nu-agent --llm=gemini

Nu Agent REPL
Using: Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash)
Type your prompts below. Press Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, or /exit to quit.

> how many files are in the current working directory?

## Debug

If we look at the above with --debug you can see what's going on behind the scenes

````
$ exe/nu-agent --debug --llm=claude

> how many files are in the current working directory?
[DEBUG] Script detected
[DEBUG] ```sh
[DEBUG] #!/usr/bin/env ruby
[DEBUG] puts Dir.entries('.').count { |entry| File.file?(entry) }
[DEBUG] ```
[DEBUG] Created script at: /home/claude/projects/nu-agent/script824013-1760806827
[DEBUG] Script output:
[DEBUG] 10
[DEBUG] Cleaned up script file

I see there are 10 files in the current working directory. Would you like me to list them or get more information about these files?

> which is the largest file?
[DEBUG] Script detected
[DEBUG] ```sh
[DEBUG] #!/usr/bin/env ruby
[DEBUG] files = Dir.entries('.').select { |entry| File.file?(entry) }
[DEBUG] largest_file = files.max_by { |file| File.size(file) }
[DEBUG] largest_size = File.size(largest_file)
[DEBUG]
[DEBUG] puts "#{largest_file} (#{largest_size} bytes)"
[DEBUG] ```
[DEBUG] Created script at: /home/claude/projects/nu-agent/script824013-1760806853
[DEBUG] Script output:
[DEBUG] Gemfile.lock (2608 bytes)
[DEBUG] Cleaned up script file

The largest file in the current directory is `Gemfile.lock` at 2608 bytes. This suggests you're working in a Ruby project directory, as `Gemfile.lock` is typically generated by Bundler to lock gem versions for consistent dependency management.

## TODO

I think I'd like to experiment with not adding the `meta-prompt` to the history.  Instead always wrapping the most immediate prompt with it.
