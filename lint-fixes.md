## Priority 1: Low Complexity (Quick Wins) ✓

### All 73 offenses fixed! (100% complete)

## Priority 2: Medium Complexity (Refactoring)

### Remaining: 13 offenses

- [ ] **Metrics/ParameterLists** (9) - Methods with >5 parameters
  - Requires refactoring to use keyword arguments hash or extract objects
  - Pattern: Create options/config objects
  - Effort: Medium - requires design decisions

- [ ] **Metrics/ClassLength** (4) - Classes >250 lines
  - `lib/nu/agent/application.rb` (1224 lines)
  - Requires extracting classes/modules
  - Effort: High - significant refactoring

- [ ] **Lint/MissingSuper** (1) - Missing super call in initialize
  - Review inheritance and add super if needed
  - Effort: Low-Medium

## Priority 3: High Complexity (Architecture)

### Remaining: 162 offenses

These require significant refactoring and should be addressed through:
1. Extract Method refactoring
2. Extract Class refactoring
3. Simplify conditional logic
4. Reduce nesting depth

- [ ] **Metrics/MethodLength** (50) - Methods >25 lines
  - Extract helper methods
  - Break into smaller focused methods
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Metrics/AbcSize** (44) - Complex methods (Assignment/Branch/Condition)
  - Simplify logic
  - Extract helper methods
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity** (27) - Too many conditionals
  - Simplify branching logic
  - Use polymorphism or strategy pattern
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Metrics/PerceivedComplexity** (27) - Complex nested logic
  - Flatten nesting
  - Early returns
  - Guard clauses
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Metrics/BlockLength** (9) - Blocks >25 lines
  - Extract methods from blocks
  - Effort: Medium-High

- [ ] **Metrics/BlockNesting** (4) - Too deeply nested blocks
  - Flatten nesting
  - Extract methods
  - Effort: High

## Recommended Fix Order

1. ✅ **Phase 1 (Low-hanging fruit):** Fix Priority 1 items - COMPLETE!
   - Fixed all 73 offenses (100% complete)
   - Reduced total from 200 → 175 (25 offenses fixed)
   - Actual time: ~1 hour

2. **Phase 2 (Structural improvements):** Address Priority 2 items (13 offenses)
   - Medium impact, medium effort
   - Improves maintainability
   - Estimated time: 4-6 hours
   - Items: Metrics/ParameterLists (9), Metrics/ClassLength (4), Lint/MissingSuper (1)

3. **Phase 3 (Architecture):** Tackle Priority 3 items (162 offenses)
   - High impact, high effort
   - Requires careful planning and testing
   - Should be done incrementally
   - Estimated time: Multiple days/weeks
   - Items: Metrics/MethodLength (50), Metrics/AbcSize (44), Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity (27), Metrics/PerceivedComplexity (27), Metrics/BlockLength (9), Metrics/BlockNesting (4)

## Notes

- Always run tests after each fix: `bundle exec rspec`
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Follow TDD for any new code (see AGENT.md)
- Prioritize readability over just fixing metrics
