# RuboCop Lint Fixes Progress

**Current Status:** 248 total offenses (down from 289 initial)
**Progress:** 41 offenses fixed (14% reduction)

## Completed ✓

- [x] **Auto-correctable offenses** - 16 fixed
  - Removed useless variable assignments
  - Fixed automatic line breaks

- [x] **Layout/LineLength** - 27 fixed (42 → 15, 64% reduction)
  - Used heredocs for multi-line strings
  - Shortened variable names in code
  - Broke long descriptions across lines
  - Extracted intermediate variables

## Priority 1: Low Complexity (Quick Wins)

### Remaining: 73 offenses

- [ ] **Lint/UnusedMethodArgument** (34) - Remove unused params from signature
  - Pattern: `def execute(arguments:, history:, context:)` → `def execute(arguments:)`
  - Remove parameters that are not used in the method body
  - Files: Tools classes, various methods
  - Effort: Low-Medium - requires checking each method for actual usage

- [ ] **Layout/LineLength** (15) - Finish remaining violations
  - 10 in tools files (parameter descriptions)
  - 3 in spec files (test expectations)
  - 2 in dir tools
  - Effort: Low - apply same patterns as before

- [ ] **Style/FormatString** (9) - Use modern string formatting
  - Pattern: `"%.6f" % value` → `format("%.6f", value)` or use interpolation
  - Effort: Low - mechanical replacement

- [ ] **Style/ComparableClamp** (5) - Use `.clamp()` method
  - Pattern: `[[x, min].max, max].min` → `x.clamp(min, max)`
  - Effort: Low - simple method call replacement

- [ ] **Style/FormatStringToken** (4) - Consistent format string style
  - Related to FormatString fixes
  - Effort: Low

- [ ] **Lint/DuplicateBranch** (3) - Merge duplicate branch bodies
  - Requires code review to merge safely
  - Effort: Low-Medium

- [ ] **Naming/AccessorMethodName** (2) - Rename accessor methods
  - Methods that look like accessors but behave differently
  - Effort: Low - rename methods

- [ ] **Gemspec/RequiredRubyVersion** (1) - Align version requirements
  - Update gemspec or .rubocop.yml to match
  - Effort: Low - configuration change

## Priority 2: Medium Complexity (Refactoring)

### Remaining: 13 offenses

- [ ] **Metrics/ParameterLists** (9) - Methods with >5 parameters
  - Requires refactoring to use keyword arguments hash or extract objects
  - Pattern: Create options/config objects
  - Effort: Medium - requires design decisions

- [ ] **Metrics/ClassLength** (4) - Classes >250 lines
  - `lib/nu/agent/application.rb` (1212 lines)
  - Requires extracting classes/modules
  - Effort: High - significant refactoring

## Priority 3: High Complexity (Architecture)

### Remaining: 162 offenses

These require significant refactoring and should be addressed through:
1. Extract Method refactoring
2. Extract Class refactoring
3. Simplify conditional logic
4. Reduce nesting depth

- [ ] **Metrics/MethodLength** (50) - Methods >25 lines
  - Extract helper methods
  - Break into smaller focused methods
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Metrics/AbcSize** (44) - Complex methods (Assignment/Branch/Condition)
  - Simplify logic
  - Extract helper methods
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity** (27) - Too many conditionals
  - Simplify branching logic
  - Use polymorphism or strategy pattern
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Metrics/PerceivedComplexity** (27) - Complex nested logic
  - Flatten nesting
  - Early returns
  - Guard clauses
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Metrics/BlockLength** (9) - Blocks >25 lines
  - Extract methods from blocks
  - Effort: Medium-High

- [ ] **Metrics/BlockNesting** (4) - Too deeply nested blocks
  - Flatten nesting
  - Extract methods
  - Effort: High

- [ ] **Lint/MissingSuper** (1) - Missing super call in initialize
  - Review inheritance and add super if needed
  - Effort: Low-Medium

## Recommended Fix Order

1. **Phase 1 (Low-hanging fruit):** Fix Priority 1 items (73 offenses)
   - High impact, low effort
   - Immediate improvement in code quality
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

2. **Phase 2 (Structural improvements):** Address Priority 2 items (13 offenses)
   - Medium impact, medium effort
   - Improves maintainability
   - Estimated time: 4-6 hours

3. **Phase 3 (Architecture):** Tackle Priority 3 items (162 offenses)
   - High impact, high effort
   - Requires careful planning and testing
   - Should be done incrementally
   - Estimated time: Multiple days/weeks

## Notes

- Always run tests after each fix: `bundle exec rspec`
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Follow TDD for any new code (see AGENT.md)
- Prioritize readability over just fixing metrics
